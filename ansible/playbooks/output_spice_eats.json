I really appreciate how you give exact quantities with weights — it makes following your recipes so easy and foolproof!<br><br>It would be great if you could share recipes using other meats like beef or pork (if it’s not something you cook for religious reasons, I completely understand). Also, lately, I’ve noticed many of your recipes are on the richer side with a lot of cream — would love to see some traditional-style dishes too, like Andhra green chicken or Maharashtrian chicken. And I’ve barely seen any paneer recipes from you — would love to see more of those as well!"}

The butter garlic prawns turned out absolutely fantastic - perfectly cooked and packed with flavor. The silky butter sauce, infused with just the right amount of garlic, gave every bite a rich and aromatic touch without being overpowering. It’s a dish that feels indulgent yet beautifully balanced, and it was a real delight to enjoy. Truly a recipe worth keeping and making again. Thank you very much."}

Rezala that I&#39;m used to uses additional items like mix powder, garam masala, base gravy, etc.  All of that was missing and the outcome tasted like it was incomplete.  Look at Misty Ricardo&#39;s version and you&#39;ll see what I am describing."}
